Hardware interrupt selection
To configure a line as interrupt source, use the following procedure:
 Configure the corresponding mask bit in the EXTI_IMR register.
 Configure the Trigger Selection bits of the Interrupt line (EXTI_RTSR and EXTI_FTSR)
 Configure the enable and mask bits that control the NVIC IRQ channel mapped to the
EXTI so that an interrupt coming from one of the EXTI line can be correctly
acknowledged.


For the ADC, configure the desired I/O in analog mode in the GPIOx_MODER
register and configure the required function in the ADC registers.


Follow this procedure to enable the ADC:
1. Clear the ADRDY bit in ADC_ISR register by programming this bit to 1.
2. Set ADEN=1 in the ADC_CR register.
3. Wait until ADRDY=1 in the ADC_ISR register and continue to write ADEN=1 (ADRDY
is set after the ADC startup time). This can be handled by interrupt if the interrupt is
enabled by setting the ADRDYIE bit in the ADC_IER register.


Software must write to the ADCAL and ADEN bits in the ADC_CR register if the ADC is
disabled (ADEN must be 0).
Software must only write to the ADSTART and ADDIS bits in the ADC_CR register only if
the ADC is enabled and there is no pending request to disable the ADC (ADEN = 1 and
ADDIS = 0).
For all the other control bits in the ADC_IER, ADC_CFGRi, ADC_SMPR, ADC_TR,
ADC_CHSELR and ADC_CCR registers, software must only write to the configuration
control bits if the ADC is enabled (ADEN = 1) and if there is no conversion ongoing
(ADSTART = 0).
Software must only write to the ADSTP bit in the ADC_CR register if the ADC is enabled
(and possibly converting) and there is no pending request to disable the ADC (ADSTART =
1 and ADDIS = 0)
